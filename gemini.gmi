# Welcome

Hi, I'm Will.

I'm writing a Gemini server in Crystal-lang and I'm hosting what I have in-progress here.

Currently I've implemented:
* TLS connection
* TCP server
* recognizing the requested url
* logging datetime + requested url
* built-in static file handler 

Thanks for stopping by! I'll be adding further support for the Gemini protocol over the next few days, hopefully.
